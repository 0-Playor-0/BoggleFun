To run the game, first run the main.py file

The Game:
The game is a jumbled nxn grid of letters on which words are formed by connecting adjacent letters. 
Some players like to tap the words out, but the fastest way to play is to swipe your way to victory.
Form as many words as possible within the two minute time frame. Words may be formed vertically, horizontally and diagonally.


The code has been clearly segmentized for easy understanding and the comments hopefully make it easier to understand the code.



After running main, you have the option to choose how big you would like the grid to be. This defines the size of the grid where the grid is n*n and you enter n.
Now, it will ask you if you want to continue. If yes, type anything except "No" or "no". If no, typing no will exit the game. If yes, you will be asked to type the coordinates
of the first letter in the format of "x,y". Then, you will be asked to type the coordinates of the next letter, again in the format "x,y". When done type "done" or "Done" or 
"no" or "No" to check if your word is valid. If not, type another word. If it is, its points get added, and you get to choose if you would like to enter another word. Once done,
type "no" or "No" when they ask "Would you like to continue?". It will tell you your score.
